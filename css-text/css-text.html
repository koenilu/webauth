    Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
We were victims of the night
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and the fading light
Oh we were bound to get together
Bound to get together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discotheque Juliet teenage dream
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
Oh, c'mon girl
Deep in her eyes
I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm
I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said
Oh don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance
Don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said you're holding back
She said shut up and dance with me
This woman is my destiny
She said oh oh oh
Shut up and dance with me
Oh oh oh shut up and dance with me
Oh oh oh shut up and dance with me

    t was late last night
    I was feeling something wasn't right
    There was not another soul in sight
    Only you, only you
    So we walked along
    Though I knew that there was something wrong
    And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
    About you
    Then you gazed up at me
    And the answer was plain to see
    'Cause I saw the light
    In your eyes (in your eyes)
    In your eyes (in your eyes)
    Though we had our fling (we had our fling)
    I just never would suspect a thing (suspect a thing)
    'Til that little bell began to ring (began to ring)
    In my head, in my head
    But I tried to run (I tried to run)
    Though I knew it wouldn't help me none (not help me none)
    'Cause I couldn't ever love no one
    Or so I said
    But my feelings for you
    Were just something I never knew
    'Til I saw the light
    In your eyes (in your eyes)
    In your eyes (in your eyes)
    But I love you best
    It's not something that I say in jest
    'Cause you're different, girl, from all the rest
    In my eyes
    And I ran out before
    But I won't do it anymore
    Can't you see the light
    In my eyes? (In my eyes)
    In my eyes (in my eyes)
    In my eyes (in my eyes)
    In my eyes (in my eyes)
    In my eyes (in my eyes)

    Hello, it's me
I've thought about us for a long long time
Maybe I think too much but something's wrong
There's something here, doesn't last too long
Maybe I shouldn't think of you as mine
Seeing you or seeing anything as much I do you
I take for granted that you're always there
I take for granted that you just don't care
Sometimes I can't help seeing all the way through
It's important to me
That you know you are free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me
Think of me
You know that I'd be with you if I could
I'll come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should
me
(That you know you are free) free
'Cause I never want to make you change for me
Think of me
You, you know that I'd be with you if I could
Come around to see you once in a while
Or if I ever need a reason to smile
And spend the night if you think I should
