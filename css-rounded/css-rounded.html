    <p id="one">"See ya later, Purp!" Purp looked back behind him, as he exited the workshop. "You as well, Wes." Purp was a tad bit annoyed, the machine that he and Wes had been working on for the past 2 months wasn't working. Purp knew that there was a part that they didn't have, but getting that part would require lots of effort on his part. He let out a loud sigh and walked on. Today was not a flying day. Today, Purp wanted to take it easy, and walk to the post office. After all, he'd have to fly for work. As he walked along, the usual little vendors started to set up shop. They'd wave to him, but Purp could only muster a half smile as he walked on by. Finally, he walked into the front door of the post office and was greeted with a large pile of packages. Ughhhhh, Purp thought, why today? Why so much? Purp grabbed the packages, and ran back into the street, taking off. 
    Angelo, the owner of the post office, walked into the front room of the post office from the back hall and immediately noticed that all the packages were gone, and there was no trace of Purp anywhere. "Those dragons," he proclaimed, "always taking things and running off. When will it ever end?"
    Purp flew through the air and was completely enveloped in himself. Today wasn't going well for him. He wasn't going to let that affect his job, yet he knew he couldn't put in the same level of 'happiness' that he would typically have. So, he flew on, not minding anyone or anything. Today was a bit easier than usual, but there were quite a few packages. Nothing too far away, only a planet over. Sometimes Purp would think to himself, what's the point in this all? Can't the other animals just go and deliver these themselves? Purp grabbed the package from the bag he carried on his back, flew down to the ground, left the package, and jumped back into the air. That's one out of… 10? Purp looked back inside his bag and, to his despair, there were 12 more packages to go. Urggggg, here we go again. 
    The next package didn’t need to be delivered much further than where he already was, it was only about an 11-minute flight. Once again, Purp closed in his wings, and came in for the precise landing, landing whilst making the dirt around him fly up. As he dropped off the package at the entrance of the cave, he noticed that there was an odd animal, that was quite metallic, that was staring directly at him. It was clearly robotic, but Purp couldn’t make out what it was. Weird, I thought I was the only one around! Purp looked at it, nodded at it, and started to jump up to fly away. Yet, as he looked over his shoulder, he noticed that it was completely gone. It was as if nothing had ever happened. Welp, there goes whatever that was. 
    Once again, Purp looked back into his sack and pulled out the next package that he would have to deliver. This one was much further away, so he had a bit of time to wonder what that was that he saw. The misshapen metal robot wasn’t like anything he had ever seen. Purp had seen robots, but that one was close to being usable, as he would call it. Sadly, he had not looked long enough at him to gather any real information about it. A loud beep sounded through Purps system, taking him completely out of any thought, and alerting him that he was close to the place where the next package needed to be delivered. Once again, Purp closed his wings, and landed quite gracefully, in front of the small hut where it needed to go. Once again, out of the corner of his eye, he saw another robot, just like the other one that he had seen earlier. Not even bothering to set the package down, Purp walked closer and closer to the machine, and its dark, red eyes continued to look back at him. “Hey, uh, are you stealing my package?” Purp looked behind him and saw a large bird, probably a parakeet, staring him down. “Uhm, no, no,” Purp responded, quickly walking back towards him, “I’m just the deliverer, you see?” Purp pointed back at the sack on his bag, then gestured towards his little badge, barely hanging onto his fur. “Oh, alright, alright.” the Parakeet responded. Purp turned his back to the bird, but after some thinking, walked back up to him. “I’m sorry, do you know what that robot is over there?” Purp pointed towards the robot, still standing, unmovingly, staring him down. “What robot? I don’t see any robots around here!” Purp glanced at him and pointed at it. “Come on now, what is it?” Once Purp turned his head back towards the robot, it wasn’t there any longer. “I really don’t know what you’re talking about, I'm sorry.” Purp looked back at the parakeet, and said, “I don't even know what I'm talking about. Have a nice day!” Purp ran off and jumped into the air. 
    Once again, Purp was back in the air, feeling more embarrassed than ever. Only 11 more packages, he thought, and then I'm done for today. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. He grabbed the next one from his bag and looked at the location. This next one was nice, it wasn’t too far away. Once again, he took a deep breath. There was no need for unnecessary stress. He had to fly on.

Not even bothering to set the package down, Purp walked closer and closer to the machine, and its dark, red eyes continued to look back at him. “Hey, uh, are you stealing my package?” Purp looked behind him and saw a large bird, probably a parakeet, staring him down. “Uhm, no, no,” Purp responded, quickly walking back towards him, “I’m just the deliverer, you see?” Purp pointed back at the sack on his bag, then gestured towards his little badge, barely hanging onto his fur. “Oh, alright, alright.” the Parakeet responded. Purp turned his back to the bird, but after some thinking, walked back up to him. “I’m sorry, do you know what that robot is over there?” Purp pointed towards the robot, still standing, unmovingly, staring him down. “What robot? I don’t see any robots around here!” Purp glanced at him and pointed at it. “Come on now, what is it?” Once Purp turned his head back towards the robot, it wasn’t there any longer. “I really don’t know what you’re talking about, I'm sorry.” Purp looked back at the parakeet, and said, “I don't even know what I'm talking about. Have a nice day!” Purp ran off and jumped into the air. 
        Once again, Purp was back in the air, feeling more embarrassed than ever. Only 11 more packages, he thought, and then I'm done for today. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. He grabbed the next one from his bag and looked at the location. This next one was nice, it wasn’t too far away. Once again, he took a deep breath. There was no need for unnecessary stress. He had to fly on.
