    <p>It was another beautiful day in the fall of 1952. The leaves were falling, and nothing seemed to be wrong as Jonathan got off the large, yellow bus. Uggh, Jonathan thought. School is so boring. He opened up the familiar red door to his red and white house. “Mom, I’m home!” Jonathan yelled as he walked through the front door. Let’s see what’s on T.V. Jonathan walked over, flipped the on switch on the T.V., and turned the dial. As he did, multiple voices spoke out through the speakers.
        “The first hydrogen bomb has successfully been deployed this year”
        “O Wheel of Fortune”
        “The Choice is clearly Chevrolet”
        “Yes, it’s Superman, strange visitor from another planet who came to earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands. And who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way. And now, another exciting episode in the adventures of Superman.”
        “Here we go,” Jonathan said as he got comfortable on the couch.
        “Hey John,” his mom said. “Can you reach something for me?” John was surprisingly tall for his age. He was 6 feet at 14 years old, so he grabbed the bowl with ease. “Love you Ma,” he quipped as he hugged her. “Love you too,” she replied, as John went back to the couch. Before he reached it, there seemed to be a black circle next to the couch. It had almost purple sparks emitting from inside it. Something inside beckoned Jonathan in. Jonathan slowly, yet surely, crept towards the black thing. He was 5 steps away, now 4, now 3. John got closer and closer. As soon as he reached it, it vanished from his sight. Weird. 
        Resuming his place on the couch, he pulled out his homework. Algebra homework was the worst. It got a little better as the year went on. Dad was out for a business trip, so he would be home later. The rest of the night seemed pretty normal, but he kept seeing those black circles everywhere. Every time that John would try to go by it, it mysteriously vanished. After his mom had put him to bed, and exited the room, there was one more black circle. Yet this time, it didn't disappear as soon as he got close to it. He continually stepped towards the circle until it was just a fingerbreadth away! Suddenly, something jumped out of it! It was a dog-like creature, but it was dressed up like that one Joker character from Batman. John jumped back and grabbed the pocketknife that his dad gave him. “Stay back!” he said as he tried to advance with the knife pointed outwards. Yet, the creature continued to advance. John started to get scared and walked backward. He hit the wall, and in shock, dropped the knife. He was trapped, with nowhere to go. John quickly scrambled to grab a scrap piece of paper and scribbled something on it. With one of its very large paws, the creature pulled out a bag from behind its back and gestured for John to go into it. Jonathan decided to take one last chance, and faked walking up to the bag. As soon as he got close, John kicked the dog, and started to run through his house. John grabbed the front door, and swung it open. He started to run, but then bumped into something really hard. John looked upwards, and saw the blue sphere surrounding his house. It was a force field. John was stuck inside of a little section close to his house, and another one of the dog things that was outside saw John running. He quickly signaled to the other dogs, and now there were 4 dog creatures coming after John! John ran back to the house, but the door slammed open and the dog from before was standing there, looking angry as ever. Jonathan got scared, and started to retreat. John was about 2 steps into his run, when one of the dogs shot him. John winced, and looked at his right hand where he had been shot. Turns out, there was no bullet mark. There was just a small black square on his hand, that had a little light that was flashing. It made 2 beeps, and then started to multiply. John started to get even more scared as he tried to get the black thing off. As hard as he tried, the black thing was latched onto the back of his hand. By this time, the multiplying black machinery had already covered up all of John’s fingers, and was making it across his chest, and covering him like a onesie would. John tried to move his right hand, yet the machinery was too strong and he couldn't move it a bit. John had stopped running at this point, and the dog things were just casually walking up to him. Now, the black things had completely covered his left arm, and had taken control of his right leg and was starting on the left. John lost all of his sense of balance, and fell backwards to the ground. John needed to sit up, but now everything below his neck was covered and he couldn't move. The black things then started the trek up his neck, coming right up to his chin, now his nose, and it covered up all of his hair. The only things left that were able to be seen was his forehead and his eyes. All of the dogs surrounded him, and one of them waved at him. John attempted to struggle out of the suit, but whatever he did, he couldn't move. One of the dog things had a circular thing that said on the back of it, “Controller for body suit 3.” One of the dogs pressed a button, and John felt his body start to move. The body tight suit sat him up, and then he stood up. John tried to force it backwards, or do something. He even completely relaxed all of his muscles! Yet, the suit continued to walk. One of the dogs then pressed a button on his belt, and one of the black circles opened from before. Yet, this time, it was large enough for all of the dogs to easily fit through. “Oh yeah, I almost forgot.” one of the dogs said. He pressed a button on his belt and the force field powered down. John’s suit had stopped walking, and was now facing one of the dogs. “Don’t try to run away.” it said. That dog then raised the gun that it was holding. It looked super futuristic, like something out of Commando Cody, with it's compact feel. The dog then attached a little jar to the bottom of it. “Also, don't try to hurt any of my pack ever again.” John attempted to talk back, but the suit was so tight around his mouth that he was surprised that he was even breathing. The dog then pulled the trigger. John felt the impact of it, but it didn't hurt. The suit then started squeezing him then relaxing him. Now, John started to feel the impact of the beam. First, his senses were failing, almost as if he was floating. On top of that, the suit smushing him then not was way too much stimuli. Then, the next round came in. Against his will, John’s eyes started to shut, and he felt himself slipping away. There was no way to stop it. The last thing John saw was the suit closing in over his eyes, urging him to sleep. So, he did. 
        
        The next morning, John’s mom ran into his room to tell him to wake up from school. She was taken aback to see the unsheathed knife on the ground. On the bed, there was a little piece of paper. She picked it up. It read: Be back soon, love you.

Jonathan slowly, yet surely, crept towards the black thing. He was 5 steps away, now 4, now 3. John got closer and closer. As soon as he reached it, it vanished from his sight. Weird. 
        Resuming his place on the couch, he pulled out his homework. Algebra homework was the worst. It got a little better as the year went on. Dad was out for a business trip, so he would be home later. The rest of the night seemed pretty normal, but he kept seeing those black circles everywhere. Every time that John would try to go by it, it mysteriously vanished. After his mom had put him to bed, and exited the room, there was one more black circle. Yet this time, it didn't disappear as soon as he got close to it. He continually stepped towards the circle until it was just a fingerbreadth away! Suddenly, something jumped out of it! It was a dog-like creature, but it was dressed up like that one Joker character from Batman. John jumped back and grabbed the pocketknife that his dad gave him. “Stay back!” he said as he tried to advance with the knife pointed outwards. Yet, the creature continued to advance. John started to get scared and walked backward. He hit the wall, and in shock, dropped the knife. He was trapped, with nowhere to go. John quickly scrambled to grab a scrap piece of paper and scribbled something on it. With one of its very large paws, the creature pulled out a bag from behind its back and gestured for John to go into it. Jonathan decided to take one last chance, and faked walking up to the bag. As soon as he got close, John kicked the dog, and started to run through his house. John grabbed the front door, and swung it open. He started to run, but then bumped into something really hard. John looked upwards, and saw the blue sphere surrounding his house. It was a force field. John was stuck inside of a little section close to his house, and another one of the dog things that was outside saw John running. He quickly signaled to the other dogs, and now there were 4 dog creatures coming after John! John ran back to the house, but the door slammed open and the dog from before was standing there, looking angry as ever. Jonathan got scared, and started to retreat. John was about 2 steps into his run, when one of the dogs shot him. John winced, and looked at his right hand where he had been shot. Turns out, there was no bullet mark. There was just a small black square on his hand, that had a little light that was flashing. It made 2 beeps, and then started to multiply. John started to get even more scared as he tried to get the black thing off. As hard as he tried, the black thing was latched onto the back of his hand. By this time, the multiplying black machinery had already covered up all of John’s fingers, and was making it across his chest, and covering him like a onesie would. John tried to move his right hand, yet the machinery was too strong and he couldn't move it a bit. John had stopped running at this point, and the dog things were just casually walking up to him. Now, the black things had completely covered his left arm, and had taken control of his right leg and was starting on the left. John lost all of his sense of balance, and fell backwards to the ground. John needed to sit up, but now everything below his neck was covered and he couldn't move. The black things then started the trek up his neck, coming right up to his chin, now his nose, and it covered up all of his hair. The only things left that were able to be seen was his forehead and his eyes. All of the dogs surrounded him, and one of them waved at him. John attempted to struggle out of the suit, but whatever he did, he couldn't move. One of the dog things had a circular thing that said on the back of it, “Controller for body suit 3.” One of the dogs pressed a button, and John felt his body start to move. The body tight suit sat him up, and then he stood up. John tried to force it backwards, or do something. He even completely relaxed all of his muscles! Yet, the suit continued to walk. One of the dogs then pressed a button on his belt, and one of the black circles opened from before. Yet, this time, it was large enough for all of the dogs to easily fit through. “Oh yeah, I almost forgot.” one of the dogs said. He pressed a button on his belt and the force field powered down. John’s suit had stopped walking, and was now facing one of the dogs. “Don’t try to run away.” it said. That dog then raised the gun that it was holding. It looked super futuristic, like something out of Commando Cody, with it's compact feel. The dog then attached a little jar to the bottom of it. “Also, don't try to hurt any of my pack ever again.” John attempted to talk back, but the suit was so tight around his mouth that he was surprised that he was even breathing. The dog then pulled the trigger. John felt the impact of it, but it didn't hurt. The suit then started squeezing him then relaxing him. Now, John started to feel the impact of the beam. First, his senses were failing, almost as if he was floating. On top of that, the suit smushing him then not was way too much stimuli. Then, the next round came in. Against his will, John’s eyes started to shut, and he felt himself slipping away. There was no way to stop it. The last thing John saw was the suit closing in over his eyes, urging him to sleep. So, he did. 
        
        The next morning, John’s mom ran into his room to tell him to wake up from school. She was taken aback to see the unsheathed knife on the ground. On the bed, there was a little piece of paper. She picked it up. It read: Be back soon, love you.

    <p>It was another beautiful day in the fall of 1952. The leaves were falling, and nothing seemed to be wrong as Jonathan got off the large, yellow bus. Uggh, Jonathan thought. School is so boring. He opened up the familiar red door to his red and white house. “Mom, I’m home!” Jonathan yelled as he walked through the front door. Let’s see what’s on T.V. Jonathan walked over, flipped the on switch on the T.V., and turned the dial. As he did, multiple voices spoke out through the speakers.
        “The first hydrogen bomb has successfully been deployed this year”
        “O Wheel of Fortune”
        “The Choice is clearly Chevrolet”
        “Yes, it’s Superman, strange visitor from another planet who came to earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands. And who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way. And now, another exciting episode in the adventures of Superman.”
        “Here we go,” Jonathan said as he got comfortable on the couch.
        “Hey John,” his mom said. “Can you reach something for me?” John was surprisingly tall for his age. He was 6 feet at 14 years old, so he grabbed the bowl with ease. “Love you Ma,” he quipped as he hugged her. “Love you too,” she replied, as John went back to the couch. Before he reached it, there seemed to be a black circle next to the couch. It had almost purple sparks emitting from inside it. Something inside beckoned Jonathan in.
