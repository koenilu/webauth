<p>The first settlers came to Mequon in the mid-1800s. They lived among many native americans, who some of the settlers hired to help build dams and buildings. In 1839, a trading post was established, which then solidified the community. There are many original landmarks from the 1800s still standing: churches, houses, and many other structures. One of the most prominent ones, and ones that have a weird location, is the Isham Day House. It was constructed in 1839. The city was also constructed with a lot of lutherans, so lutheran churches are very prevalant. The second Trinity Lutheran Church was built in 1884, and still stands today. In the 1950s, the city grew by 110%, which was incredibly large at the time. This put pressure on both Thiensville and Milwaukee to annex them, but Mequon was swift to get Oak Creek law, and was saved.  </p>
