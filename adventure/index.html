<dd>Today we went to <a href="https://www.rickscafejamaica.com/">Rick's cafe</a> for dinner. I almost had forgotten my phone- that wouldn't have been fun! How else was I going to record all the amazing cliff divers today? The food was great, and we overall had a lot of fun. The people were fun, and I totally recommend this place!</dd>

<dd style="color:yellow">After spending the morning at <a href="https://www.beaches.com/">Beaches,</a> beaches, today my parents took us <a href="https://www.islandroutes.com/caribbean-tours/jamaica/ocho-rios/31/treetop-zipline-experience-ocho-rios">zip lining</a>! it was cool to see all the tropical enviroments, and just immerse myself in the amazing trees and nature. I would totally recommend it! I will 100% find other places like this on the next trip we take to here. </dd>

<dd>Today we went to the 7 mile beach. It was super cool! It looked super long, and there were many locals there, playing instruments, and just overall having a good time. We even saw dolphins out in the middle of the ocean! how cool! I made sure to grab my sunscreen and my swimsuit so that i could go and swim. </dd>

<dd><strong>Today we went to the blue hole in ocho rios. kind of an odd name, don't ya think? Anyways, the water was really cool, but it seemed a bit crowded with people. must be a popular place! I just love swimming so it was a great place to go to. defenteally one of my top things i did on the trip. </dd></strong>

<dd>For our last day, we went to kingston, just because of that one song mentioning it. i forget the name off the top of my head. It was quite fun though! big cities are really cool. Lots of things to do, and some good food! It was quite a long way away, as that it is in the inner area of jamaica. </dd>
